# rpi-long-timelapse
raspberry pi year long timelapse

This project will set up a long-term time lapse with an unknown end date. The project will assume that the timelapse will be approximatley a year long, but this project should be scaleable to any duration AS LONG AS you have enough storage space. There are many factors that go into creating a timelapse, but a ballpark figure is to expect the file size *before* creating the final video (i.e. the source photos) to be approximately 1 TB. Depending on your particular setup, don't be suprized if it's 2 or 4 TB.
